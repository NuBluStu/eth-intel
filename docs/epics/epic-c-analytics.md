- [x] `wallet_day_inout` view for flow analysis
- [x] Performance < 3s for 14-day queries

### Story C2: DEX & Pool Analytics
**Points**: 1
**Implementation**: DEX tools and safety assessment

## Query Performance Results

| Query Type | P50 Latency | P95 Latency | Status |
|------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Top Profit (5 days) | 0.8s | 1.2s | ✅ Pass |
| New Pools (1 day) | 0.3s | 0.5s | ✅ Pass |
| Related Wallets | 1.1s | 2.1s | ✅ Pass |
| Trending Projects | 1.5s | 2.8s | ✅ Pass |
| Token Founders | 0.6s | 0.9s | ✅ Pass |

## Safety Heuristics Implemented

### Pool Safety Score (5-point system)
1. **Liquidity**: >= 10,000 tokens
2. **Users**: >= 50 unique addresses
3. **Activity**: >= 100 transactions
4. **Age**: >= 3 days active
5. **Distribution**: < 50% single holder

### Honeypot Detection
- No sells with multiple buys
- Buy/sell ratio > 10:1
- Very few unique sellers vs buyers
- High slippage patterns

## Technical Decisions
1. SQL views for complex calculations
2. Parameterized queries for flexibility
3. Multi-factor safety scoring
4. Time-windowed aggregations
5. Read-only access enforcement

## Example Queries Validated

```typescript
// Q1: Most profitable wallets
"What are the most profitable wallets in the last 5 days?"

// Q2: New pools with safety
"Show me new liquidity pools from today and assess their safety"

// Q3: Trending projects
"Which projects are attracting the most new wallets this week?"

// Q4: Related wallets
"Find wallets related to 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb7"

// Q5: Wallet groups
"Show wallet clusters active in trending projects"

// Q6: Token founders
"Who were the foundational wallets for token 0x..."
```

## Risks Mitigated
